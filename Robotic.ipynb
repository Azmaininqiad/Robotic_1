It seems 8x10<sup>15</sup> is the current (I), 5x10<sup>-6</sup> is the area (A), and 1.6x10<sup>-19</sup> is the elementary charge (e). The value for 'n' (number density of charge carriers) seems to be missing or perhaps is assumed to be 1.)\n* **Line 4:** = 3.84x10<sup>-11</sup> (This is the calculated result for v<sub>c</sub>, the drift velocity.)\n\n\nThe writing is on lined paper within a bordered box, suggesting it might be part of an exam or homework assignment.  The number \"11\" at the top left likely indicates the question number."

The question states:\n\n**Question:** At 20°C, the current density of the conductor is 3 x 10⁴ Am⁻² and the number of free electrons is 8 x 10²⁵ m⁻³. What is the drift velocity?\n\nThe sample answer provides the following solution:\n\n* **Formula:** I = nAve, which simplifies to j = nve.  Solving for drift velocity (v) gives v = j / (ne)\n* **Calculation:** v = (3 x 10⁴) / (8 x 10²⁵ x 1.6 x 10⁻¹⁹)\n* **Result:** v = 2.34 x 10⁻³ ms⁻¹\n\nThe marks distribution for the question is:\n\n* 3 marks for writing the correct formula (j = nve).\n* 4 marks for correctly substituting the values into the formula.\n* 3 marks for arriving at the correct drift velocity and including the unit (ms⁻¹).\n\nThe note clarifies that 1 mark will be deducted if the unit is missing or incorrect. It also states that directly inputting the values without writing the formula is acceptable."
